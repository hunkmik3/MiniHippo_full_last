But what I\'ve found is that exercising actually boosts my productivity a lot and really  helps me focus better. So, I always try to squeeze in some exercise before heading to  work—it definitely makes me more productive.\" \nB. \"We’ve all heard about the many benefits of exercising, and I know about them too.  My friends often invite me to work out, but after I exercise, I end up feeling extremely  exhausted and spend the rest of the day just lying around to recover.\" \nC. “I often go to the gym to work out, but what really motivates me to workout is  catching up with my friends there, not just for improving my health. Plus, it’s a great  way to meet and make new friends. For me, exercising is just another chance to  socialize.\" \nD.  \"My friends often advise me to exercise to maintain a good physique and health.  However, I am very busy with a tight work schedule. Even if I weren’t busy, I still  wouldn’t like to exercise. I feel uncomfortable as soon as I put on workout clothes.  I don’t think exercise is something that suits me.\"`

My mother works along  the same route, so we often drive to work together. Occasionally, she takes over the  driving, and I\'m happy because driving together gives us more time to chat\" \nC:  \"I used to use my car a lot to get to work. But since I moved closer to the company,  I always go there on foot. I have a friend who cycles for 20 minutes every day to  work—can you imagine? She must be super fit!\" \nD: \"I\'m concerned about the Earth and the environment, so I always look for ways to  use public transportation, like buses or trains, to reduce harmful emissions.

So,  I bought a one-year gym membership and go there to exercise every day.\" \nB. \"I usually wake up early in the morning to exercise, and I choose to jog on the street because of its convenience. I just need to step out of the house, and I can start  exercising. However, I have to go jogging early to avoid cyclists. My friends go to  the gym to exercise a lot, but I find something artificial about the whole thing.\" \nC.  \"I see many people wake up early to go jogging and exercise to stay healthy. As for  me, I usually walk along the beach simply to relax because there’s a beautiful beach  near my house. Every morning, I spend time walking on the white sand; it really  helps a lot with my mental well-being.\" \nD. \"Near my house, there’s a stadium where many people go to exercise. I often run on  the track there, and it makes me feel like I’m running more professionally. My  personality is quite competitive, so I also time myself and race with my friends  there.\"`

I\'m just a student, so I can\'t afford to go to the cinema regularly to indulge in  my hobby. Therefore, I think the internet is great because it allows me to watch  movies for free at home. I save both the time of going to the cinema and a  considerable amount of money.\" \nB. \"The internet is a great resource for research, finding materials, and useful  information for studying. My friends and I often go to each other\'s houses to do  homework together. Instead of spending hours trying to figure out how to do our  homework, we quickly go online and find the answers.\" \nC. \"In today\'s digital age, the internet helps us access social media to stay constantly  connected with friends. Especially since I have relatives mainly living abroad or in  distant cities, the internet has been a great help for my family to stay in touch. We often video call each other to share daily stories.\" \nD. \"I see that people often use the internet to watch movies, read newspapers, quickly  update the news, and so on. But I usually use the internet to find directions and  public transport to my friends\' and relatives\' houses. I\'m a forgetful person, and I  often forget the way, even if I\'ve been there a hundred times. So the internet helps  me a lot in not getting lost and easily find nearby public transport.\"`

If I study  in a café, I end up not getting anything done. So, I usually study in places such as  my room in my house or in my office.\" \n\nC. \"I prefer listening to music while studying. I usually play motivational songs to help  keep me alert, especially when studying in the morning. Music is like a cup of coffee,  keeping me awake and motivated in my studies.\" \n\nD. \"I often can\'t focus on studying during the day; I feel tired and sleepy when I have  to wake up early and study.

I\'m passionate about  teaching children how to draw because I love kids. I\'m also part of a volunteer  organization that specializes in teaching art to poor children, which makes me very  happy.\" \nB.  \n\"I think drawing with my children is a great way to understand them better. No  matter how busy my work is, I always make time to sit and draw with my kids. This  helps us bond more and gives me the chance to talk with them more.\" \nC. \n\"I\'ve loved literature, art, and drawing since I was a child. Now, I\'m a writer and a  comic book creator. In my stories, I occasionally include some illustrations to make  the book more vivid and lively.\" \nD. \n\"I\'m currently taking a drawing course and I really want to be serious about it.

But  I’m very afraid of this animal and never want to learn how to ride, even though  there’s a riding school near my house. Instead, I prefer mountain biking with my  friends to conquer high peaks.\" \nB. \n\"My husband and I often wake up early and go to a nearby forest for exercise. We  usually go jogging in the early morning to stay healthy, and we really enjoy the fresh air and natural scenery in the forest.\" \nC. \n\"I used to love mountain biking, enjoying the thrill of riding down steep slopes. It  was really an amazing and adventurous feeling. However, after an injury from a fall,  I became haunted by the fear of crashing and now I\'m scared of this sport. But I still  love the mountains, so I’ve decided to just go hiking every weekend instead.\" \nD. \n\"My hometown is in the countryside, and we have a very large and beautiful farm.  I’ve been learning to ride horses since I was a child, and it’s still my hobby to this  day. Whenever I want to relax or enjoy the scenery, I ride my horse along the farm  and across the meadows.\"`

  transcript: `A. \n\"I often don\'t have time to think about how to reuse my belongings or clothes, but I  don\'t want to throw them away because that would be wasteful. So, I think a better  way is to donate them to charity organizations or give them to others. Many people  are in need of these things, and \nB. \n\"A good way to protect the environment is by not using plastic bags or by bringing  reusable bags when going to the market, which helps reduce the disposal of plastic  bags, a material that is difficult to decompose. However, I\'m a very busy person and  rarely have time to prepare my own bags when going shopping, and I usually drive  to buy groceries quickly instead of walking. I guess I can\'t protect the environment  by not driving. But I have a principle of only buying eco-friendly products, so I think  I’m still contributing in a small way to protecting the Earth.\" \nC. \n\"I see that too many people are wasting food containers, as they often throw them  away after use, such as glass jars or plastic bottles. I can reuse them to store food  and neatly organize them in my refrigerator. Reusing these containers is a very easy  way to protect the environment that anyone can do.\" \nD. \n\"I find the act of giving away old or secondhand items a bit hypocritical. Why do  people give away their old things, only to go out and buy the same item but brand  new? Not only does this fail to protect the environment, but it also causes double the  harm. Personally, I have a way of protecting the environment by not releasing  harmful chemicals into it. I do this by not purchasing chemical cleaning solutions.  Instead, I make use of natural products like lemons to create my own floor-cleaning  solutions.\"`

  transcript: `I think a lot of people overemphasize protecting the environment by cutting down  on personal vehicles, avoiding plastic bags, planting a lot of trees, and so on. But I  personally believe we should focus on protecting the environment through small  daily actions we often overlook. For example, turning off the water while brushing  our teeth or washing our hands. If everyone saves a little water like that, it would  add up to a huge amount saved globally.\n\nI usually shop online to reduce the need to drive to the supermarket, which produces  harmful emissions for the environment. Additionally, I can avoid using plastic bags  for groceries when shopping in person. By simply sitting at home and clicking a few  buttons, I can buy everything I want without emitting harmful gases from a car.\n\nI used to drive to work for a long period, but then I realized that the excessive use  of personal cars contributes significantly to environmental pollution. Therefore, I  chose to ride a bicycle to work, which benefits both the environment and my health.\n\nI\'m not that into environmental protection and usually just do what’s convenient  for me. But my electric bill last month shocked me because it was so expensive, and  I realized that I needed to save money. So from now on, I’ll have to manage my  electricity use more efficiently.`

  transcript: `I used to be a person who didn’t like shopping online, but ever since I experienced  home delivery, I no longer shop in stores. When I shop online, the delivery person  brings the package right to my door, even up to my floor, and knocks on my  apartment door, so I don’t even need to step outside. I really enjoy this convenience.\n\nShopping online has helped me save quite a bit of money. After a few months of  online shopping, I was able to save enough to buy a new bicycle. But don\'t get me  wrong, I haven\'t been eating any less or cutting back on the groceries I buy. It\'s just  that online shopping allows me to compare prices and choose the store with the best deal.\"\n\nI’m a pretty busy person, and I often don’t have enough time because of my hectic  work schedule. That’s why I always shop online to save time. This way, I don’t need  to go to the store in person, and someone will deliver the items directly to me.  Additionally, online shopping is very convenient because, with just a few clicks, I  can buy everything I want without having to go from one store to another.\n\nI don\'t shop online because it\'s cheaper or because of the fast shipping. I shop  online because, when browsing online stores, I have a wide range of choices. For  the same item, there are many different types and brands for me to choose from and  compare, which allows me to pick the one I like the most.`

So, I think a better  way is to donate them to charity organizations or give them to others. Many people  are in need of these things, and \nB. \n\"A good way to protect the environment is by not using plastic bags or by bringing  reusable bags when going to the market, which helps reduce the disposal of plastic  bags, a material that is difficult to decompose. However, I'm a very busy person and  rarely have time to prepare my own bags when going shopping, and I usually drive  to buy groceries quickly instead of walking. I guess I can't protect the environment  by not driving. But I have a principle of only buying eco-friendly products, so I think  I’m still contributing in a small way to protecting the Earth.\" \nC. \n\"I see that too many people are wasting food containers, as they often throw them  away after use, such as glass jars or plastic bottles. I can reuse them to store food  and neatly organize them in my refrigerator. Reusing these containers is a very easy  way to protect the environment that anyone can do.\" \nD. \n\"I find the act of giving away old or secondhand items a bit hypocritical. Why do  people give away their old things, only to go out and buy the same item but brand  new? Not only does this fail to protect the environment, but it also causes double the  harm. Personally, I have a way of protecting the environment by not releasing  harmful chemicals into it. I do this by not purchasing chemical cleaning solutions.  Instead, I make use of natural products like lemons to create my own floor-cleaning  solutions.\""

For example, turning off the water while brushing  our teeth or washing our hands. If everyone saves a little water like that, it would  add up to a huge amount saved globally.\n\nI usually shop online to reduce the need to drive to the supermarket, which produces  harmful emissions for the environment. Additionally, I can avoid using plastic bags  for groceries when shopping in person. By simply sitting at home and clicking a few  buttons, I can buy everything I want without emitting harmful gases from a car.\n\nI used to drive to work for a long period, but then I realized that the excessive use  of personal cars contributes significantly to environmental pollution. Therefore, I  chose to ride a bicycle to work, which benefits both the environment and my health.\n\nI'm not that into environmental protection and usually just do what’s convenient  for me. But my electric bill last month shocked me because it was so expensive, and  I realized that I needed to save money. So from now on, I’ll have to manage my  electricity use more efficiently."

But don't get me  wrong, I haven't been eating any less or cutting back on the groceries I buy. It's just  that online shopping allows me to compare prices and choose the store with the best deal.\"\n\nI’m a pretty busy person, and I often don’t have enough time because of my hectic  work schedule. That’s why I always shop online to save time. This way, I don’t need  to go to the store in person, and someone will deliver the items directly to me.  Additionally, online shopping is very convenient because, with just a few clicks, I  can buy everything I want without having to go from one store to another.\n\nI don't shop online because it's cheaper or because of the fast shipping. I shop  online because, when browsing online stores, I have a wide range of choices. For  the same item, there are many different types and brands for me to choose from and  compare, which allows me to pick the one I like the most."
