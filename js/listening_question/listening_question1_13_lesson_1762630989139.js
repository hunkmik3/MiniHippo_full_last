    question: "What is not original?",
    options: ["Furniture", "Home", "Bicycle"],
    correctAnswer: "Furniture",
    transcript: "Welcome! I’m so glad you are interested in this beautiful property. This house was built in the 1920s and has maintained much of its original charm. The hardwood floors you see here are completely original, and they’ve been carefully preserved over the years. The same goes for the architecture- those high ceilings and detailed mouldings are a testament to the craftsmanship of that era. However, the furniture you see isn’t original. It was replaced a few years ago to give the home a more modern, functional feel. But don’t worry, the updates blend well with the classic features, giving you the best of both words- historic charm with modern comfort."
