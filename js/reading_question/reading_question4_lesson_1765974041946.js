    "I have a dream that I work as a tour guide. So I understand that I will have to fly to other countries. In my personal opinion, airplanes are currently too cheap compared to the damage they cause to the environment, so I believe we should add taxes to airline ticket prices to make people choose to use other means of transport before they think about flying. I believe that people are also very happy when they can contribute to protecting the environment.",
    "My family and siblings live quite far from me. So I often have to fly to visit them every month when I have time. We really appreciate the time we spend together and we are happy to be able to meet each other and share our new story. I know that traveling by plane too much is not good for the environment so I often shop online or go to work by bike instead of going by car or I reuse plastic bags and paper bags. In addition, I sometimes volunteer to clean up trash in the neighborhood.",
    "I was a businessman so I had to fly many times a week. I had to go to other countries to be able to sign wine trading contracts with them. I feel very tired every time I have to fly. Now, my sister and I, whenever we have free time, take the train together and we enjoy that time very much because I can travel while sightseeing and relax without any stress.",
    "If I have to go somewhere I will choose other means of public transport, not the plane. Every time I go on a plane I feel extremely tired and I just hope time passes quickly so I can get off that plane. However, due to the specific nature of my job, I have to film in many different locations, so sometimes I cannot avoid having to take this public transportation.",

My wife often laughs at me for doing so, but I don\'t mind, as long as I can finish reading so many books.",

When I have free time, I usually want to read light books, like mystery novels or comedy. I often read on the train to work. I have a young child, so when I come home I almost don\'t have time to read. Therefore, I have to read books when traveling by train. So, a book can last me 1 week.",

Unfortunately, I am away this weekend so I cannot help with the cleaning. However, I know my brother and his friends will be very interested in this cleanup so I will ask them if they can help.",

Besides, students and schools also have days off on weekends. I think this volunteering will be very helpful for students\' future careers.",
    "I think this volunteering is a good idea but it doesn\'t have a long-term vision. When volunteers clean up the park, it will be clean, but it will become busy again after about a month when tourist season arrives. I think we should clean this park regularly about once a month. Surrounding areas such as the lake and local forest should also be cleaned up. We should also have signs telling visitors to clean up their trash. I am very upset when I see a lot of trash on both sides of the road.",
    "My family and I often spend time at the park. My children love going to the park and they find the park a very interesting place to visit. My son has a dream of becoming a biologist so I think cleaning up this park will be very helpful for my son. I think we should pique children\'s interest in cleaning.

    "Before trying any extreme sport, I believe it\'s absolutely essential to train properly. These kinds of activities are exciting, but they can also be dangerous if you don\'t know what you\'re doing. I\'ve seen people get hurt because they didn\'t prepare well. That\'s why I always make sure to take a training course and understand the safety rules before I try anything new. With the right preparation, I think extreme sports can be a great experience.",
    "I\'ve always been more into traditional sports like swimming, running, or playing tennis. They\'re fun and easy to do regularly. But a few months ago, I went bungee jumping during a holiday, and it was an incredible experience. I didn\'t expect to enjoy it so much! I still prefer regular sports for everyday fitness, but now I\'m definitely more open to trying extreme sports once in a while for adventure.",
    "What I love most about extreme sports is how they let me enjoy nature in a different way. Activities like rock climbing or mountain biking allow me to explore amazing places while challenging myself physically and mentally. It\'s a way to disconnect from daily life and feel completely alive. If I had more time and money, I\'d love to do these kinds of sports more often- especially in wild, remote areas.",
    "I know some people find extreme sports exciting, but for me, they\'ve never been important. I actually avoid them as much as possible. I don\'t like the idea of putting myself in danger just for fun. There are plenty of safer ways to stay active and enjoy life. I\'d rather go for a walk or do yoga than jump out of a plane or climb a mountain. It\'s just not my thing.",

    "For me, the most important thing about extreme sports is being well-prepared. Many people think it’s all about excitement and courage, but I don’t see it that way. Without proper training, it’s easy to get hurt or even put others at risk. I once took a rock-climbing course and spent weeks learning how to use the equipment correctly. After that, the actual climb was much more enjoyable because I felt confident. I believe training not only keeps you safe but also makes the experience more relaxed and rewarding.",
    "I’ve always preferred traditional sports like swimming and running because they help me stay healthy without being too risky. Still, I was curious about how extreme sports might feel, so I tried bungee jumping during a holiday last year. At first, I was really nervous, but once I jumped, the feeling was incredible. It was a kind of thrill I had never felt before. Even so, I still swim every week because it’s safer and more practical, though I admit extreme sports can be exciting to try at least once.",
    "Honestly, I don’t really understand why people enjoy extreme sports. They seem dangerous and unnecessary to me. I’ve never tried one, and I don’t intend to. Some friends have invited me to go snowboarding or paragliding, but I always refuse. It’s not that I dislike sports—I actually enjoy cycling and tennis—but I just don’t see any reason to risk my health for a few seconds of excitement. In my opinion, extreme sports aren’t essential for happiness, so I stay away from them whenever I can.",
    "What I love most about extreme sports is that they often take place in beautiful natural settings. Last summer, I went kayaking on a wild river, and the scenery was breathtaking. I also tried mountain biking through the forest and loved the feeling of fresh air and freedom. For me, it’s not just about the sport itself but also about being surrounded by mountains, trees, and rivers. I sometimes wish I had more time and money to do these activities more often. Extreme sports give me energy and make me feel close to nature.",

Flexible schedules are a big help, but I always make sure to plan ahead so I can balance both work and family life. These are the moments that create lasting memories.",

    "When I was a teenager, I loved recording short stories on an old tape recorder with my cousins. We spent hours coming up with ideas and acting them out just for fun. These days, we make podcasts using modern apps that make editing and publishing much easier and more enjoyable. Even though technology has simplified the process, we still spend a lot of time planning each episode carefully. For me, podcasting is a creative way to express ideas and connect with people on a deeper level.",
    "As a child, I spent many sunny afternoons flying kites in the park with my brothers and sisters. Watching my kite rise high into the sky always filled me with happiness and excitement. Those simple yet meaningful moments taught me patience and coordination. Even now, whenever I see children flying kites, I feel warm memories returning. Those carefree days will always be some of my favorite childhood moments.",
    "When I was little, I was fascinated by doing jigsaw puzzles with my family. Carefully fitting each piece into place was both fun and satisfying. Now that I’m older, I often play strategy-based video games, which feel like a modern version of puzzles. They’re not only entertaining but also help me stay focused and think critically. For me, these games bring the same sense of challenge and accomplishment that puzzles once did — just in a more dynamic and interactive way.",
    "I grew up near a beautiful lake, and swimming there with my friends was one of my favorite things to do. It was such a great way to spend time outdoors, though rainy days sometimes left me feeling bored at home. Nowadays, I practice yoga to relax and recharge after long working hours. It has helped me stay calm, balanced, and focused. Yoga has become an important part of my routine and a great way to take care of both my body and mind.",

    "When I was a child, I loved sitting by the fireplace listening to my grandfather’s folktales. His voice brought every character to life, and those evenings always felt magical—they taught me the power of imagination. Nowadays, I share that same joy with my nieces by reading interactive storybooks on tablets. The animations and sounds make the stories more vivid and exciting for them. Still, I always take care to choose content that’s suitable for their age. To me, blending old traditions with modern technology is a beautiful way to keep storytelling alive across generations.",
    "When I was a young, I used to ride my bike around the village with my friends almost every afternoon. I can still recall the feeling of the wind brushing against my face, the excitement of racing each other, and the pure sense of freedom it brought. Those simple rides weren’t just fun—they taught me what independence and adventure felt like, lessons that stayed with me as I grew up. Nowadays, it’s a bit sad to see that many children spend more time indoors, glued to screens instead of exploring outside. Sometimes I find myself missing those carefree afternoons when happiness was as simple as pedaling down a dusty road. Thinking back, I realize those moments helped me develop a love for the outdoors and a lasting appreciation for friendship.",
    "As a kid, I could spend hours drawing animals, trees, and landscapes with my box of crayons and pencils. I loved playing with bright colors and shapes, and I always felt proud showing my drawings to my family. What started as a simple childhood hobby slowly turned into a lifelong passion. Now, I’m a graphic designer, creating digital art for various clients. Modern design tools help me bring my ideas to life with more precision, yet the creative joy I feel is just like it was back then. For me, drawing has always been a way to express myself—and it still fills my days with happiness.",
    "When I was growing up, I loved going on camping trips with my family in the countryside. We pitched our tents, cooked simple meals over a fire, and spent long nights gazing at the stars. Those moments made me feel deeply connected to nature and left me with unforgettable memories. Sometimes, though, rainy weather would ruin our plans, and I always felt a bit sad when we had to stay indoors. These days, my adventures have taken a different form — I enjoy visiting museums and exhibitions instead. Exploring history through artifacts and stories gives me a similar sense of curiosity and wonder, just in a quieter, more comfortable setting. To me, museums are a gentle way to travel through time and appreciate the beauty of the past.",

Now, I’ve learned that there are shorter courses available in this field, and I regret not choosing that option instead.",

It rained heavily on the first two days, which made it difficult to enjoy the outdoor activities. I still got wet in the tent. But I didn\'t let that ruin the experience. On the final day, the skies cleared up and the performances were truly amazing — especially the final act in the evening. That last day made it all worthwhile, and I left with some great memories despite the poor weather.",

The sound quality wasn\'t great, and the whole event just felt disorganised. There weren\'t enough facilities, and the staff didn\'t seem prepared to handle the crowd. I couldn\'t even interact with the band. I don\'t think I\'ll be coming back next year. It\'s simply not worth the money or the time anymore.",
    "The festival this year had one of the best line-ups I\'ve seen so far. I absolutely loved the energy of the performances, and the music was spot on throughout the weekend. However, I have to say the ticket prices were far too high, especially for students. I paid almost double what I did two years ago, and although I enjoyed the music, I\'m not sure it offered good value for money. If they don\'t lower the prices next year, a lot of people might skip it.",
    "We were playing in a band and we finished our performance in the morning. However, I stayed at the festival to meet up with some old band mates. We talked a lot. However, I didn\'t like the venue. It was too crowded and not well organised. The road to the tent village was also congested. I think they should choose a better location next year.",

In my personal opinion, airplanes are currently too cheap compared to the damage they cause to the environment, so I believe we should add taxes to airline ticket prices to make people choose to use other means of transport before they think about flying. I believe that people are also very happy when they can contribute to protecting the environment.",

We really appreciate the time we spend together and we are happy to be able to meet each other and share our new story. I know that traveling by plane too much is not good for the environment so I often shop online or go to work by bike instead of going by car or I reuse plastic bags and paper bags. In addition, I sometimes volunteer to clean up trash in the neighborhood.",

Now, my sister and I, whenever we have free time, take the train together and we enjoy that time very much because I can travel while sightseeing and relax without any stress.",

Every time I go on a plane I feel extremely tired and I just hope time passes quickly so I can get off that plane. However, due to the specific nature of my job, I have to film in many different locations, so sometimes I cannot avoid having to take this public transportation."

These kinds of activities are exciting, but they can also be dangerous if you don't know what you're doing. I've seen people get hurt because they didn't prepare well. That's why I always make sure to take a training course and understand the safety rules before I try anything new. With the right preparation, I think extreme sports can be a great experience.",

But a few months ago, I went bungee jumping during a holiday, and it was an incredible experience. I didn't expect to enjoy it so much! I still prefer regular sports for everyday fitness, but now I'm definitely more open to trying extreme sports once in a while for adventure.",
          "What I love most about extreme sports is how they let me enjoy nature in a different way. Activities like rock climbing or mountain biking allow me to explore amazing places while challenging myself physically and mentally. It's a way to disconnect from daily life and feel completely alive. If I had more time and money, I'd love to do these kinds of sports more often- especially in wild, remote areas.",

I don't like the idea of putting myself in danger just for fun. There are plenty of safer ways to stay active and enjoy life. I'd rather go for a walk or do yoga than jump out of a plane or climb a mountain. It's just not my thing."

          "For me, the most important thing about extreme sports is being well-prepared. Many people think it’s all about excitement and courage, but I don’t see it that way. Without proper training, it’s easy to get hurt or even put others at risk. I once took a rock-climbing course and spent weeks learning how to use the equipment correctly. After that, the actual climb was much more enjoyable because I felt confident. I believe training not only keeps you safe but also makes the experience more relaxed and rewarding.",
          "I’ve always preferred traditional sports like swimming and running because they help me stay healthy without being too risky. Still, I was curious about how extreme sports might feel, so I tried bungee jumping during a holiday last year. At first, I was really nervous, but once I jumped, the feeling was incredible. It was a kind of thrill I had never felt before. Even so, I still swim every week because it’s safer and more practical, though I admit extreme sports can be exciting to try at least once.",
          "Honestly, I don’t really understand why people enjoy extreme sports. They seem dangerous and unnecessary to me. I’ve never tried one, and I don’t intend to. Some friends have invited me to go snowboarding or paragliding, but I always refuse. It’s not that I dislike sports—I actually enjoy cycling and tennis—but I just don’t see any reason to risk my health for a few seconds of excitement. In my opinion, extreme sports aren’t essential for happiness, so I stay away from them whenever I can.",
          "What I love most about extreme sports is that they often take place in beautiful natural settings. Last summer, I went kayaking on a wild river, and the scenery was breathtaking. I also tried mountain biking through the forest and loved the feeling of fresh air and freedom. For me, it’s not just about the sport itself but also about being surrounded by mountains, trees, and rivers. I sometimes wish I had more time and money to do these activities more often. Extreme sports give me energy and make me feel close to nature."

          "When I was a child, I loved sitting by the fireplace listening to my grandfather’s folktales. His voice brought every character to life, and those evenings always felt magical—they taught me the power of imagination. Nowadays, I share that same joy with my nieces by reading interactive storybooks on tablets. The animations and sounds make the stories more vivid and exciting for them. Still, I always take care to choose content that’s suitable for their age. To me, blending old traditions with modern technology is a beautiful way to keep storytelling alive across generations.",
          "When I was a young, I used to ride my bike around the village with my friends almost every afternoon. I can still recall the feeling of the wind brushing against my face, the excitement of racing each other, and the pure sense of freedom it brought. Those simple rides weren’t just fun—they taught me what independence and adventure felt like, lessons that stayed with me as I grew up. Nowadays, it’s a bit sad to see that many children spend more time indoors, glued to screens instead of exploring outside. Sometimes I find myself missing those carefree afternoons when happiness was as simple as pedaling down a dusty road. Thinking back, I realize those moments helped me develop a love for the outdoors and a lasting appreciation for friendship.",
          "As a kid, I could spend hours drawing animals, trees, and landscapes with my box of crayons and pencils. I loved playing with bright colors and shapes, and I always felt proud showing my drawings to my family. What started as a simple childhood hobby slowly turned into a lifelong passion. Now, I’m a graphic designer, creating digital art for various clients. Modern design tools help me bring my ideas to life with more precision, yet the creative joy I feel is just like it was back then. For me, drawing has always been a way to express myself—and it still fills my days with happiness.",
          "When I was growing up, I loved going on camping trips with my family in the countryside. We pitched our tents, cooked simple meals over a fire, and spent long nights gazing at the stars. Those moments made me feel deeply connected to nature and left me with unforgettable memories. Sometimes, though, rainy weather would ruin our plans, and I always felt a bit sad when we had to stay indoors. These days, my adventures have taken a different form — I enjoy visiting museums and exhibitions instead. Exploring history through artifacts and stories gives me a similar sense of curiosity and wonder, just in a quieter, more comfortable setting. To me, museums are a gentle way to travel through time and appreciate the beauty of the past."

It felt very natural for me to learn that kind of work, so later I studied for two years at university to become an electrician. Now, I’ve learned that there are shorter courses available in this field, and I regret not choosing that option instead.",

          "Growing up, I was fascinated by books about inventors and their innovative creations. Those stories inspired my imagination. Today, I design prototypes using 3D modeling software. The tools are much more precise now, but the joy of creating something new still feels just like the excitement of those childhood books.",
          "I spent many hours as a child exploring my family’s old computer, learning basic commands. Rainy days often meant staying indoors and experimenting with different software. Today, I keep up with the latest innovations by listening to tech podcasts. They’re not only entertaining but also help me stay connected to the ever-evolving tech world."

          "This was my first time attending the Music Festival, and to be honest, the weather really didn't cooperate. It rained heavily on the first two days, which made it difficult to enjoy the outdoor activities. I still got wet in the tent. But I didn't let that ruin the experience. On the final day, the skies cleared up and the performances were truly amazing — especially the final act in the evening. That last day made it all worthwhile, and I left with some great memories despite the poor weather.",
          "I've been to this festival a couple of times in the past, the quality was good the last time I came, but this time is completely different. The sound quality wasn't great, and the whole event just felt disorganised. There weren't enough facilities, and the staff didn't seem prepared to handle the crowd. I couldn't even interact with the band. I don't think I'll be coming back next year. It's simply not worth the money or the time anymore.",
          "The festival this year had one of the best line-ups I've seen so far. I absolutely loved the energy of the performances, and the music was spot on throughout the weekend. However, I have to say the ticket prices were far too high, especially for students. I paid almost double what I did two years ago, and although I enjoyed the music, I'm not sure it offered good value for money. If they don't lower the prices next year, a lot of people might skip it.",
          "We were playing in a band and we finished our performance in the morning. However, I stayed at the festival to meet up with some old band mates. We talked a lot. However, I didn't like the venue. It was too crowded and not well organised. The road to the tent village was also congested. I think they should choose a better location next year."
